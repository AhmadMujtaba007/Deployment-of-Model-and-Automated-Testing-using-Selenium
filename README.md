# Deployment-of-Model-and-Automated-Testing-using-Selenium

The objective of this  activity was to carry out research, analysis, design, investigation, and implementation of a real-world software engineering project that involves the deployment of a machine learning model and automated testing using Selenium. This activity requires abstract thinking, creativity in analysis, and the application of engineering principles and research-based knowledge in novel ways


## Milestones
The milestones achieved in this project include:

Creation of a Machine Learning model or any management system of your choice.
Use of Python's pickle library for serializing and de-serializing Python objects.
Development of an HTML form to collect data.
Utilization of Flask, a Python-based micro framework, for creating a Restful API.
Creation of a script.py file in the project folder for running the Flask application.
Running the application using the Flask development server.
Integration of Selenium scripts for automated testing based on project requirements.
